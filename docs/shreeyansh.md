# Hello,  

My name is **Shreeyansh Singh**. I’m currently in my second year of BTech in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Ajay Kumar Garg Engineering College, Ghaziabad.

I have a strong passion for technology in all its forms, whether it's AI, web development, blockchain, or any emerging field. I’m curious about how different technologies can be applied to solve real-world problems, and I enjoy learning new tools, frameworks, and concepts. My long-term goal is to work on innovative and impactful tech projects that create real value.

Outside academics, I enjoy playing basketball and reading, as both help me stay focused, motivated, and open to continuous learning. I’m excited for the opportunity to grow, contribute, and gain meaningful experience.
