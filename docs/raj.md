# Hey there! 👋

Just some demo stuff here, nothing too crazy.

## About Me

I'm Raj and I like to code stuff. This is just a test page to see how Docusaurus works.

## Random Things I Like

- Coffee ☕
- Pizza 🍕  
- Coding late at night 🌙
- Good music while working 🎵

## Some Code Snippet

Here's a simple function because why not:

```javascript
function sayHello(name) {
  return `Hey ${name}, what's up?`;
}

console.log(sayHello("world"));
```

## Fun Fact

Did you know that octopuses have three hearts? Pretty wild, right?

## That's It

This is just demo content. Nothing fancy, just testing things out!
